# Using Pytorch for Chemistry.

Following along with the [Using Pytorch for chemistry page](https://shuan4638.github.io/2021/05/01/PyTorch/) by Shuan Chen.

## Steps to machine learning.

In most cases there are 3 steps to perform machine learning.

1. Load or Collect Data
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Train, Valicate and Test your model

For machine learning in chemistry steps 1 and 2 require high domain knowledge.
